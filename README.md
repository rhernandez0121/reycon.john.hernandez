Online Automation Assessment

Question 1:  What other possible scenarioâ€™s would you suggest for testing the Jupiter Toys application? 
Answer: It would be great if Login is part of the test. It is commonly included in all automation hands on. 
It would also be great if we include Start Shoppingg button in Homepage works correctly.

Question 2: Jupiter Toys is expected to grow and expand its offering into books, tech, and modern art. We are expecting the of tests will grow to a very large number.

    What approaches could you used to reduce overall execution time?
    Answer: I think headless automation is one of the keys if we want to reduce the execution time especially if we will run similar tests 
    against the new items you've mentioned above. Though I believe it is not advisable if we run similar tests against the new items. 
    Or if there will be no restrictions when it comes to authentication, we can run tests in parallel. 
    
    How will your framework cater for this?
    Answer: I will use Data driven approach on this. Though I was not able to apply it on my project due to time constraint. But it would be great to have 
    Data Driven approach as we provide items to buy and we have to validate if the calculation is correct. 
    
 Question 3. Describe when to use a BDD approach to automation and when NOT to use BDD 
 Answer: We usually recommend BDD frameworrk if the tests that we need to peform is always end-to-end. 
 BDD also helps the communication between development team and stakeholders easier as they write the test in simple language. 
I think I will not recommend using BDD framework if you need to test the application pieces by pieces or close to Unit Testing. 
Also, if the project is not a long term, it's not advisable to use BDD as maintaining the framework requires time and effort.
